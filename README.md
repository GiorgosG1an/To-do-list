# To-Do-List

**Author:** Giannopoulos Georgios

A simple to-do list implemented as my first project with Ruby. This project serves as a beginner's exploration into Ruby classes, variables, and functions. The goal is to provide a straightforward understanding of these concepts while creating a functional to-do list application.

## Features

- **Add Tasks:** You can add tasks to your to-do list by entering their names through the menu.
- **Mark as Completed:** Tasks can be marked as completed, updating their status within the list.
- **View To-Do List:** The application allows you to view your current to-do list with task status and names.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GiorgosG1an/ToDoList.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd to-do-list
    ```

3. Run the Ruby script:

    ```bash
    ruby todo_list.rb
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the script, a simple menu will guide you through the following options:

1. **Add Task:** Enter a task name to add it to your to-do list.
2. **View Tasks:** Display all tasks in the to-do list with their current status.
3. **Mark Task as Done:** Choose a task index to mark it as completed.
4. **Exit:** Quit the to-do list application.
