# To-do-list
Author: Giannopoulos Georgios
A simple to do list done as my first project with Ruby.
This is my first ruby project, it prints a simple menu and you can add tasks, mark them as completed and view your to do list.
A good starting project just to get used to with Ruby classes, variables and functions. 
The project does not take any serious advantages of Ruby.
